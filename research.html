                Technology research services provide buyers of software and hardware with data and information to make a more informed purchasing decision. These services may source their data from technology analysts who have built relationships with technology vendors to gather a deeper understanding of tools, or from crowdsourced peer data that builds recommendations based on unbiased user feedback. Additionally, technology research firms often run surveys and speak with customers directly to gain further knowledge of software and hardware.

                Technology research services provide reports and direct recommendations based on the information they present to potential buyers. They may offer in-depth information into new and emerging spaces, product comparisons, and recommendations of technology solutions based on industry or company size. These services are employed by anyone researching software, whether thatâ€™s a decision-maker tasked with choosing a solution or a VP of information technology who makes bigger technology purchasing decisions. Users may opt to employ multiple services simultaneously to ensure that they are making the right investment for their business.
