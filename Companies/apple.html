        <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc;;">One of the world's favorite tech brands, Apple has a tight hold on its spot as one of the tech Big Four. Founded by, and still led in the spirit of, the legendary Steve Jobs, Apple products have found their way into seemingly every household. The company only hires the best of the best, and looks for whip-smart people who will push the envelope when it comes to what personal technology can do.

            <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc;;">
                Apple is one of the best-known tech companies of all time, one of the Big Five of tech, and for good reason. From the latest iPhone to the original Apple computer, the company has been an ingenious innovator of consumer technologies since its first days out of a home garage. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak met through a mutual friend. It turned out to be a fated meeting that would change the path of modern technology forever. Steve Wozniak created the original prototype for the Apple I computer—the first computer to resemble the computer we know today—a model with a large monitor and a keyboard. Jobs saw the prototype and quickly realized its potential. Together, the two founded Apple Computers Inc. on April 1, 1976.

            <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc">Apple offers consumer technologies of all kinds. Some of its most popular products include the iPhone, iPad, Macbook, and Apple Watch. Apple has 147,000 employees in numerous departments, including retail, software services, hardware, machine learning and AI, support and service, design, and more. Apple also offers services like Apple Music, which launched in June 2015, and Apple TV, which launched in 2019. By 2021, Apple TV had produced two Academy-Award-nominated features, Wolfwalkers for Best Animated Feature and Greyhound for Best Sound. Apple also provides products and services specifically curated for education, business, health care, and government. After Steve Jobs left his post as CEO in 2011 prior to his death, Tim Cook took on the role. As a top member of the Fortune 500, Apple is one of the world’s largest technology companies and its catalogue of offerings continues to grow.

                <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc">Not only is Apple tech savvy, it's business savvy. Apple has made some huge acquisitions and investments throughout its history. It acquired NeXT Computer in 1996, Beats Electronics in 2014, Shazam in 2017, and Texture in 2018, just to name a few. The company’s drive towards innovation is bolstered by its ability to invest in companies like these that have greatly improved its catalogue of technologies.

                    Competition from IBM
Apple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate: by 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees. Its public offering in December was the biggest since 1956, when the Ford Motor Company had gone public. (Indeed, by the end of 1980, Apple’s valuation of nearly $2 billion was greater than Ford’s.) However, Apple would soon face competition from the computer industry’s leading player, International Business Machines Corporation. IBM had waited for the personal computer market to grow before introducing its own line of personal computers, the IBM PC, in 1981. IBM broke with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software and built a machine from readily available components, including the Intel microprocessor, and used DOS (disk operating system) from the Microsoft Corporation. Because other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used, as well as license DOS from Microsoft, new software developers could count on a wide IBM PC-compatible market for their software. Soon the new system had its own killer app: the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, which won an instant constituency in the business community—a market that the Apple II had failed to penetrate.
