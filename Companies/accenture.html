        <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc">Accenture by far has proven to be a major player in the tech world and also one of the biggest IT companies in the world and finest software companies in the world.
            </p>

            <p style="width:600px;margin-left:-80px;line-height: 1.8; font-size:20px;color:#dcdcdc">In 1989, Accenture plc, formerly known as Anderson Consulting, split from the accounting firm Arthur Anderson– a firm for which it was formerly the business and technology consulting division. The two companies broke all contractual ties in 2001.

                    To further assure you of this firm’s credibility, know that it has big brands like Unilever, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Marriott as its clients.
                    
                    Accenture shares sold at over $303 per share and sustained a market capitalization of over US $192.24 Billion as of April 2022
